# VPN server port forwarding

üíÅ Each VPN service provider supporting port forwarding have their own section on their own page on how to set it up.

üî¥ This is **NOT** about [Docker port mapping](../port-mapping.md)

## Native integrations

VPN server side port forwarding is implemented natively into Gluetun for the following providers:

- **Private Internet Access**, [more information](../providers/private-internet-access.md)
- **ProtonVPN**, [more information](../providers/protonvpn.md)

You can enable it with `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING=on`.
The forwarded port can be accessed:

- through the [control server](control-server.md#openvpn-and-wireguard)
- through the file written at `/tmp/gluetun/forwarded_port` (will be deprecated in v4.0.0 release)
- by running a user specified command upon port forwarding starting (see below)

## Custom port forwarding up/down command

A command can be set with:

- `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING_UP_COMMAND` to run when port forwarding has finished setting up
- `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING_DOWN_COMMAND` to run when port forwarding has finished tearing down

For example `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING_UP_COMMAND=/bin/sh -c "echo {{PORTS}}"`.

Notes:

- The special string `{{PORTS}}` is replaced by a comma separated list of the ports that have been forwarded. For example `/bin/sh -c "echo {{PORTS}}"` would become `/bin/sh -c "echo 5678,9876"`
- shell specific syntax such as `&&` is not understood in the command, and one should use `/bin/sh -c "my shell syntax"` to do so if they want.
- one can bind mount a shell script in Gluetun and execute it with for example `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING_UP_COMMAND=/bin/sh -c /gluetun/myscript.sh` - üíÅ  feel free to propose a pull request to add commonly used shell scripts for port forwarding!
- the output of the command is written to the port forwarding logger within Gluetun

### qBittorrent Example

See [qbittorrent-port-updater.sh](scripts/qbittorrent-port-updater.sh) for an example of how this can be done. Add a bind mount to this script and then refert to it: `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING_UP_COMMAND=/bin/sh -c "/tmp/qbit-port-updater.sh {{PORTS}}"`

Notes:

- In order to get the call working make sure port qBittorrent is listening on is open. For example `- 8080:8080` to the ports definition. Without this calls do not go through.
- Add `127.0.0.1/32` to bypass authentication settings for qBittorrent.

## Allow a forwarded port through the firewall

For non-native integrations where you have a designated forwarded port from your VPN provider, you can allow it by adding it to the environment variable `FIREWALL_VPN_INPUT_PORTS`.

## Test it

Assuming:

- your gluetun container name is `gluetun`
- your VPN public IP address is `99.99.99.99`
- your VPN port forwarded is `4567`

You can test it with:

```sh
docker exec -it gluetun /bin/sh
# Change amd64 to your CPU architecture
wget -qO port-checker https://github.com/qdm12/port-checker/releases/download/v0.3.0/port-checker_0.3.0_linux_amd64
chmod +x port-checker
./port-checker -port 4567
```

Then in your browser, access [http://99.99.99.99:4567](http://99.99.99.99:4567).

It should show you your browser IP address and user agent.
You should also see the request logged in the port-checker output.

Finally, back to the terminal, press `CTRL+C` to stop port-checker and enter `exit` to quit the interactive shell in `gluetun`.
